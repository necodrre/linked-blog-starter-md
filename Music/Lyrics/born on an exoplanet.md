you born on an exoplanet
your light could get me
but it’s too late
because i’m dead
27th of july
that was so tough but you were right
  
you told me it’s alright
and i was like fine

[instrumental]
  
you born on an exoplanet
your light could get me
but it’s too late
but i’m okay
27th of july
that was so tough but you were so right
